Node.js comes with a package manager called **NPM**. It allows for downloading and managing of Node.js packages. It can also be used as a tool for front-end JavaScript.


A package in Node.js contains all the files that may be needed in a module. **Modules** are JavaScript libraries that can be included in the project.


Throughout this course, the Node packages **Express** and **CORS** and **Body-Parser** will be used. The CORS package allows for communication across the web. The Body-Parser package allows for parasing data that will eventually pass through routes on the server. It's considered a category of middleware.

**Cors** is manually used for allowing communication between the server and browser without security interruptions.

The packages can be installed in the terminal using the commands:

```
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install cors
```
