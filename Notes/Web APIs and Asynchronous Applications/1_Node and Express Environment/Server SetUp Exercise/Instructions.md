In this set of exercises you will demonstrate creating and starting a server with Node and Express. Your serve!
1) Create a server with a callback function. Inside the callback function, log the port number so you can see it is working.

2) Test your server by running the `starter.js` file from the terminal. *Make sure you have saved your file before running the terminal command.*

Note that you can open a second terminal in the toolbar with `File>New>Terminal`. You can use the `curl` command with `localhost:{your port}` to see if your server returns what you expect.
