**In this set of exercises you will tangle with POST routes and your favorite animal.**

1) In the file, `server.js`, create a POST route that uses the url `/add` and sends the response `POST received` when used to make a request.


2) Add a POST route for adding a favorite animal via the path `/animal` to an array named `data`. You will need to create the array as well.
