# **Exercise: Sass Conversion**

Currently all of the files in our github app are CSS file format - except the Sass resets file that I have provided for you. Now, you should translate all the remaining files from CSS to Sass. Note that this time, you'll want to `cd` into `webpack-sass` to start.

*HINT* - The least effort you could put out to complete this step would be to change all the file names to .scss and leave the content all the same. CSS is valid Sass!
