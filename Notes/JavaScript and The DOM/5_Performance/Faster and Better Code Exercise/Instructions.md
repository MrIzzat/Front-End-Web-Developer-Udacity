# Performance Exercise

In this exercise you will measure the execution time for a very inefficient function that iterates through an array and updates the array values with a new value.

Next, you will create an updated function to remove the inefficiencies and measure the execution time for that funcion.

> Note: We are using the Node `perf_hooks` library to allow us to use performance in the Node environment

## Instructions

1. Open the `slow.js` file
2. Review the test code and understand how the `slowArrayMaker` code works.
3. Run the code and note the results.

   ```bash
   node slow.js
   ```
4. Add code to create a faster array maker in the `fastArrayMaker` function.
5. Run the code again.  Is your code faster?  If not, try again.

If you get stuck, look at the `fast.js` code.

> DO NOT change the code in the `testCode` function.
