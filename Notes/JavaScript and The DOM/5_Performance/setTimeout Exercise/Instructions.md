# setTimeout Exercise

In this exercise you use `setTimeout` to delay execution of the code so that the statements are logged to the console in the correct order.

## Instructions

1. Open the `messages.js` file
2. Review the code and run it to see how it works:
   ```bash
   node messages.js
   ```
4. Add `setTimeout` statements to delay some of the `console.log` statements so they run in the correct order, e.g.
   ```bash
   Message 1
   Message 2
   Message 3
   Message 4
   Message 5
   ```

5. Run the code again. Does it work as expected?

If you get stuck, see the code in `solution.js` for some possible solutions.
