# Instructions

We have created a model of an animal trading card using concatenation in card.js Your job is to create a second version of the same card that uses template literal syntax.

*You can ignore the code at the bottom of the card.js file. You'll learn how to create the code that appends the HTML strings to the web page when you learn how to create content with JavaScript*

When you run the server and view the web page (see instructions below), you should see two identical animal trading cards side-by-side on the page.



# Need a hint?
Make sure to start your template literal with a `` ` `` instead of a `'`.
You will want to make sure that when you are referring to variable names, you use ``${animal.variableName}`` instead of just animal.variableName.
Remember that template literals do not need to use `+` for concatenation, so you can remove all of the additional `+` and `'` characters.
