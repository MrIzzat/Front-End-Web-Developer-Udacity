> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)is an open-source backend JavaScript runtime environment. That basically means that it will run your JavaScript code in the terminal and return any output that is generated. We'll be using Node to run the code in our workspaces for some of the quizzes in this lesson.
