# Arrow Functions with Map

## Intructions
reate an arrow function named `doubleOdd` that takes in an array of numbers and uses map to return an array where all of the odd numbers are doubled.

### Requirements

- Your function must be named `doubleOdd`.
- `doubleOdd` must be an arrow function.
- `doubleOdd` must take an array as a parameter.
- You must to `map` to iterate through the array.
- You must use an arrow function inside your `map` statement.
- `doubleOdd` must return an array with all of the odd numbers doubled and the even number unchanged.

### Running Your Code

Enter the following in the terminal:
```bash
node arrow.js
```

### Expected Results
There is some testing code in the rest.js file. If you have met the requirements for this exercise, you should get this message in the console when you run rest.js:

```bash
Your code passes!
```

If your code doesn't pass all of the tests, you'll get this message:
```bash
Your code fails. Try again!
```
