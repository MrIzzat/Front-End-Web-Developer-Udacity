**HTML** stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's used to structure the elements of a website. Hypertext refers to code words within the file that a browser can use to display the web page properly.

**HTML** is like the skeleton of the webapge, i.e. the foundation.
**CSS** is like the skin, i.e. the style.
**JavaSCript** is like the brain, i.e. the functionality and behavior.

Some basic HTML tags include:

* **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Most HTML web documents start with this. It's used to tell the browser the following file is an HTML file

* **`<html>`** and **`<\html>`**: The first usually comes right after the doctype tag and the second closes the first tag. It's used to indicate everything in between is HTML.

* **`body`** and **`<\body>`**: Most of the content of the webpage will be within the body tag. It's not usually required as most browsers assume if something is not contained within a tag it's part of the body.

There is also the **`<head>`** section that comes before the body.

Demo usage of these tags would look like this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
    <!-- Page Content -->
    </body>
</html>
