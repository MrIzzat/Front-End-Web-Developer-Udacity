An HTML element is made up of 4 key items:

1. the opening tag.
2. The information between the tags. This is the only part that is displayed on the browser
3. The closing tag.
4. Attributes of the element which are contained within the opening tag. these are optional.

For example:

`<p class='dog-breed'>Labarador Retriever</p>`

The opening tag would be the `<p>`

`Labrador Retriever` is what gets displayed on the screen.

The closing tag is `</p>`

`class='dog-breed'` is an attribute.
