There are three ways to set the order of items that will appear in a grid:

* Arranging the HTML code in a way to make them ordered
* Appending `-reverse` to `row` or `column` to reverse the order of the specified row or column
* Using the `order` property of the individual items inside the grid. It's specifically for flexbox items.

A flexbox is considered to be a grid.
