**Flexbox** stands for flexible box model. It's used for aligning and distributing elements in a parent element. A flex container can expand and fit the items available inside of it. Some of the CSS properties are used only for the parent and others only on the items.


In order to make use of the flexbox properties, all that needs to be done is to set the `display` property to `flex`.
