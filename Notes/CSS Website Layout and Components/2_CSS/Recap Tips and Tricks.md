There are some tricks that can be done with the `border-radius` and `padding` properties to make oval labels and keep the text viewable.

There are also some tricks with the `background-image` and `background-size` properties to display an image in the back background of an element. Giving `background-size` the `cover` value will make the image the background. Using `contain` will make the image repeat until it fills the entire screen. The background image will match modifications in the border radius and padding.
