CSS is used for the styling of webpages. Instead of a website being barebones, CSS allows for the changing of colors as well as many other attributes. In the real world, a front end developer will receive a high fidelity design for the website. The front end developer's job is to take that design and use the necessary computer code to convert it into a webpage. This is where CSS is utilized.

Fidelity is the measure of how close a sketch or design is to the final product. A basic design of a webpage has low fidelity while a design that is very close to the final product has high fidelity.


Wireframes tend to be low fidelity, because they tend to be in monochrome with placeholder images and text

Mockups tend to be between medium to high fidelity that use real images, colors and text

Prototypes tend ot be high fidelity that use branding, images, text and sometimes interactivity (buttons and clicking).
